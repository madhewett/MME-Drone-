I. Articles
1. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2257080
This article discusses the legality issues with drone use, as well as the conversation of privacy in residential areas.

This article discusses the use and innovation that could be emplaced with the use of drone videography. The idea being in scenarios when a videographer is unable to capture important events, a drone can be utilized to record and document important events.

This article is a research project by Lisa King, who is a Research senior fellow at the Curtin Sarawak Research Institute located in Malaysia, questions whether drones will revolutionize ecotourism. That being said, environmental NGOs are now "investing the relationship beUNESCO brands and natural area tourism " in regard to protecting threatened natural habitats. The idea being that these reservations will be more monitor-able and well protected with the use of record capable drones.

This article questions and dives into the increase of public concern in regards to the expanding use of personal drones throughout Asia, specifically in Taipei, Taiwan. Many of these drones are designed and produced within Asia, so many countries are looking towards governments such as those in Taiwan to see how to respond to this new issue. The article looks into "[the] right balance between the freedom of expression and freedom to create art, and the purported competing demands of safety, privacy, and commercial interests can be struck – or not" as well as questions what is the best height, distance, weight, line of sight limitations, licensing, etc.

This article goes more into the commercial side of drone videography in the context of construction as well as interest of private industries of the expansion of the use of drones in a commercial setting. This article is particular looks at a cement company and its use as a tool within that industry.

II. Briefly explain the main idea behind the technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?

"Aerial video is an emerging form of data acquisition for scene understanding and object tracking. The video is captured by low flying aerial platforms that integrate Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and automated image processing to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction.” (Wikipedia)

III. Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.

1. DJI: A Chinese technology company that specializes in the manufacturing of drones used for arial film and videography. The company itself accounts for 85% (Wikipedia) of the drone sales globally. They are known for their Phantom Drone series.

2. Ian Smith: An FAA-certified pilot who currently works for Dronedeploy, a company that creates platforms for drone users, as well as hosts the Commercial Drones FM Podcast where he explores new technologies and concepts within the drone industry.

3. Ran Krauss: The CEO of Airobotics, a company "that enables clients to run automatic missions monitoring, inspecting, surveying, and securing large industrial facilities and other strategic sites such as mines and seaports” (Commercial UAV News). He changed the way automatic drones are used within mainstream consumption and his company was the first to be granted certification to fly automated drones without a pilot.

4. Amazon: In 2013, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, stated his plan for the use of drones to deliver packages.
