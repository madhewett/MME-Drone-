This article discusses the use and innovation that could be emplaced with the use of drone videography. The idea being in scenarios when a videographer is unable to capture important events, a drone can be utilized to record and document important events.

This article is a research project by Lisa King, who is a Research senior fellow at the Curtin Sarawak Research Institute located in Malaysia, questions whether drones will revolutionize ecotourism. That being said, environmental NGOs are now "investing the relationship beUNESCO brands and natural area tourism " in regard to protecting threatened natural habitats. The idea being that these reservations will be more monitor-able and well protected with the use of record capable drones.

This article questions and dives into the increase of public concern in regards to the expanding use of personal drones throughout Asia, specifically in Taipei, Taiwan. Many of these drones are designed and produced within Asia, so many countries are looking towards governments such as those in Taiwan to see how to respond to this new issue. The article looks into "[the] right balance between the freedom of expression and freedom to create art, and the purported competing demands of safety, privacy, and commercial interests can be struck – or not" as well as questions what is the best height, distance, weight, line of sight limitations, licensing, etc.

This article goes more into the commercial side of drone videography in the context of construction as well as interest of private industries of the expansion of the use of drones in a commercial setting. This article is particular looks at a cement company and its use as a tool within that industry.

II. Briefly explain the main idea behind the technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?

"Aerial video is an emerging form of data acquisition for scene understanding and object tracking. The video is captured by low flying aerial platforms that integrate Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and automated image processing to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction.” (Wikipedia)

III. Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.

1. DJI: A Chinese technology company that specializes in the manufacturing of drones used for arial film and videography. The company itself accounts for 85% (Wikipedia) of the drone sales globally. They are known for their Phantom Drone series.

2. Ian Smith: An FAA-certified pilot who currently works for Dronedeploy, a company that creates platforms for drone users, as well as hosts the Commercial Drones FM Podcast where he explores new technologies and concepts within the drone industry.

3. Ran Krauss: The CEO of Airobotics, a company "that enables clients to run automatic missions monitoring, inspecting, surveying, and securing large industrial facilities and other strategic sites such as mines and seaports” (Commercial UAV News). He changed the way automatic drones are used within mainstream consumption and his company was the first to be granted certification to fly automated drones without a pilot.

4. Amazon: In 2013, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, stated his plan for the use of drones to deliver packages.

IV. What are the important historical events/milestones in the development of this technology and why do they seem particularly note worthy?

1. 1849 – Austrian balloons. "unmaned ariel vehicle, Austria launched a pilotless balloon bomb attack against Venice. The attack caused little damaged, but Venice surrendered two days later."
2. 1916 – World War 1 – Hewitt-Sperry, the first unmanned aircraft ' develop an aerial torpedo, also called a flying bomb or pilotless aircraft, capable of carrying explosives to its target'.
3. 1918 – US Army Develops Kettering Bug " an experimental, unmanned aerial torpedo, a forerunner of present-day cruise missiles. It was capable of striking ground targets up to 121 kilometres from its launch point, while traveling at speeds of 80 kilometres per hour"
4. 1930 – US Navy creates radio-controlled aerial aircraft "attempts to create an airborne counterpart of the naval torpedo took place in the United States during World War I. A pilotless plane was to be guided to a target and crashed into it in a power dive, exploding its charge.

In 1916-17 a prototype called the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane made a number of short test flights proving that the idea was sound. In November 1917 Army representatives witnessed one of these flights and started a similar aerial torpedo, or flying bomb, project led by Lieut. Col. Bion J. Arnold for the Air Service and Charles Kettering for industry."
5. 1940 – Radioplane OQ2 – The first large-scale UAV production "The OQ-2 Radioplane was the first mass-produced UAV or drone in the United States, manufactured by the Radioplane Company. A follow-on version, the OQ-3, became the most widely used target drone in US service, with over 9,400 being built during World War II."
6. 1973 – Mastiff UAV – Unpiloted surveillance vehicle "battlefield UAV built by Tadiran Electronic Industries, regarded by military historians as the world's first modern military drone. It first flew in 1973."
7. 1982 – Battlefield UAVs "The usefulness of UAVs for aerial reconnaissance was demonstrated to the United States in the Vietnam War. At the same time, early steps were being taken to use them in active combat at sea and on land, but battlefield unmanned aerial vehicles would not come into their own until the 1980s."
9. 1985 – US – large-scale UAV development

10. 1986 – RQ2 Pioneer Reconnaissance drone "The AAI RQ-2 Pioneer is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that had been utilized by the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Army, and deployed at sea and on land from 1986 until 2007. Initially tested aboard USS Iowa, the RQ-2 Pioneer was placed aboard Iowa-class battleships to provide gunnery spotting, its mission evolving into reconnaissance and surveillance, primarily for amphibious forces."
11. 1996 – Predator Drone "The General Atomics MQ-1 Predator is an American remotely piloted aircraft built by General Atomics that was used primarily by the United States Air Force and Central Intelligence Agency."
12. 2006 – UAVs permitted in US civilian airspace "As new technologies present these options to policymakers, it is an opportune time to establish general principles and legal guidelines for the government’s use of drones in domestic airspace. These guidelines should go beyond safety and transit issues that are addressed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the agency that oversees regulation of civil aviation, and should define the scope of permissible federal activities. Congress should play an active role in establishing the guidelines."
13. 2010 – Parrot AR Drone is released "Parrot AR.Drone is a remote controlled flying quadcopter helicopter built by the French company Parrot. The drone is designed to be controlled by mobile or tablet operating systems such as the supported iOS or Android[1] within their respective apps or the unofficial software available for Windows Phone, Samsung BADA and Symbian devices"
14. 2013 – DJI releases the Phantom 1 UAV "The Phantom 1, originally known as Phantom, was released in January 2013. It was commonly equipped with a GoPro camera for amateur filmmaking or photography. Its battery life was around 10 minutes with a GoPro.".
15. 2013 – Amazon Drone Delivery "We're excited about Prime Air — a delivery system from Amazon designed to safely get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles, also called drones. Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system. (1st november 2016)"
16. 2014 – Film and TV Use "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-drones-hollywood-20151008-story.html"
"Sheppard points to the fact that drones allow the reader to build a better mental picture of the layout of the land, not least on a sports field or racing tack. Sandra Hossack of SkyPower agrees. “A news story about immigration comes alive to the viewers when sweeping shots are taken of the presenter over the white cliffs of Dover,” she says “Or a drone flying above a car racing down a mountain road adds to the excitement when the surrounding terrain is visible.” SkyPower has filmed sequences for the likes of Holby City and forensic procedural Silent Witness."
