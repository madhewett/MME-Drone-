II. Briefly explain the main idea behind the technology you're researching, what is it exactly? what is it for? How does it work?

"Aerial video is an emerging form of data acquisition for scene understanding and object tracking. The video is captured by low flying aerial platforms that integrate Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and automated image processing to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction.” (Wikipedia)

III. Who are the important people and/or organizations related to this technology? Don't just list names, briefly explain who these are and what their relationship to your research area is.

1. DJI: A Chinese technology company that specializes in the manufacturing of drones used for arial film and videography. The company itself accounts for 85% (Wikipedia) of the drone sales globally. They are known for their Phantom Drone series.

2. Ian Smith: An FAA-certified pilot who currently works for Dronedeploy, a company that creates platforms for drone users, as well as hosts the Commercial Drones FM Podcast where he explores new technologies and concepts within the drone industry.

3. Ran Krauss: The CEO of Airobotics, a company "that enables clients to run automatic missions monitoring, inspecting, surveying, and securing large industrial facilities and other strategic sites such as mines and seaports” (Commercial UAV News). He changed the way automatic drones are used within mainstream consumption and his company was the first to be granted certification to fly automated drones without a pilot.

4. Amazon: In 2013, Amazon CEO, Jeff Bezos, stated his plan for the use of drones to deliver packages.
