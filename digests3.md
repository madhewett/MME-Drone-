Summary: Huge corporations such as Walmart, Amazon (ie Whole Foods), and Dominos are planning the use drones for their companies. Walmart recently proposed to for the use of drones specifically for their farmers, who could use the drone camera technology to help achieve arial footage of their farms to "to spot crop problems, selectively apply chemicals and help disperse pollen". Pushing the idea further, Walmart also proposed the idea of the use of the dispensing of pesticides from the drone. The goal being to create more efficient and cost effective crop. Walmart is not the first company to emplace drones for crop with "Theyâ€™re [drones] already used to survey fields, providing imagery farmers can use to estimate harvest size or identify systemic problems like nutrient deficiencies. This has been legal according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) since 2016". More recently, Walmart has applied for over forty-five drone patens, the majority of them focusing on delivery systems.
